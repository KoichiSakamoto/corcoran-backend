# corcoran-backend


Hello, this is my code challenge for the Full Stack Development Position at Corcoran.

The frontend is done in React, and the backend is done in Node.js with Express.js.

I hope you can forgive me for the crude styling!

This took me around 1.5 hours of pure coding, done over the course of an evening.

The frontend is comprised of only 2 React Components. Typically for a project I like to make everything its own little component, but for the sake of this excercise I figured simplicity would be better. Local state is stored within the HelloCorcoran.js Component. Upon rendering, the component will enact a get request to the backend API, upon which it will store the served JSON into the local state. There are three routes for the API, one for a standard chronological order, one for an ascending order, and one for a descending order. The data is stored in the API as a simple .js object, as I figured that would be the fastest way to implement it.

Thank you for the opportunity to present this to you! I appreciate your time.

Sincerely, Isaac Fiore
